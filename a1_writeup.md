# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I am so far kinda confused about it and I feel like I don't know what is the same and different from Java and I need to work on what syntax to use. I also don't fully understand the percents. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python and Java both use similar phrasing and structure with while loops, if statements, etc. Both take user input and give output.  

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Through this assignment, I learned that python can be more straightforward than Java, and there are more shortcuts. I also learned that you don't need semicolons after everything.
